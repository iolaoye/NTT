  welcome_note:
    thanks: 'Thank you very much for using this program. The current version of “Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT): Next generation” is designed to assess the environmental and economic impacts of various management practices on water and air quality at the field or small watershed level. The NTT is an Internet-based program and requires no software to download. NTT imports the required databases, such as weather, soil, management, and land geometry at the selected land (agricultural, forestry, and urban) for the user using the existing GIS and non-GIS based database anywhere in the mainland United States. The NTT simulate the baseline and numerous conservation management scenarios using the APEX (Agricultural Policy/Extender; Williams et al. 2010) (Version 0806) model. Please review “about NTT” section for information regarding the new functions and science in current version of NTT. For detailed information please refer to the manual or contact Dr. Ali Saleh by e-mail at saleh@tiaer.tarleton.edu or by phone (254) 968-9799.'
    note1: '1. Although the database in NTT available for mainland USA, access to the databases for NTT simulation is limited to where the NTT has been tested and verified. This assure the users that results obtained from this version of NTT is relatively reliable for the conditions where the program has been verified. However, the last version of NTT (www.nn.tarleton.edu/ntt) allows the users to access the data throughout the mainland US.'
    note2: '2. This version of NTT is written both in English and Spanish.'
    final: 'Finally, as the NTT project leader and behalf of all of my project team (Oscar Gallego and Edward Osei), I would like to thank the funding sources and our colleagues, in particular the farmers and producers, for their contribution in designing this program.'

    overview0: 'Nutrient Tracking Tool'
    overview1: 'The <strong>Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT)</strong> was designed and developed by the Texas Institute for Applied Environmental Research (TIAER), Tarleton State University with funding from USDA Office of Environmental Markets, USDA-NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants program, and various state agencies.'
    overview2: 'NTT is a web-based, site-specific application that estimates nutrient and sediment losses at the field scale or at the small watershed scale.'
    overview3: 'Agricultural producers and land managers can define a number of management scenarios and generate a report showing the expected nutrient loss differences between any selected scenarios for a given field or small watershed.'
    overview4: 'NTT compares agricultural management systems to calculate a change in expected flow, nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment losses, and crop yield. Estimates are made using the <strong>APEX</strong> model (Williams et al. 2000). Results represent average losses from the field based on 35 years of simulated weather.'
    overview5: 'NTT requires regional soils, climate and site-specific crop management information. NTT currently provides selections for <strong>every U.S. county</strong>, but it has only been validated for a limited number of states and counties. As validation becomes possible in other parts of the country, parameter files may be updated for additional counties in future versions.'

    apex0: 'About APEX'
    apex1: 'NTT uses a biophysical simulation model, the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender model (APEX), version 0806, to process user supplied information (APEX; Williams et al., 2000). Below are characteristics of the APEX model.'
    item1: 'The  <a href="https://epicapex.tamu.edu/"><u>APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender)</u></a> model was developed to extend the <strong>EPIC</strong> model capabilities to whole farms and small watersheds (Williams et al., 2000).'
    item2: 'The individual field simulation components of EPIC were used for APEX development.'
    item3: 'In addition to the EPIC functions, APEX has components for <strong>routing water, sediment, nutrients,</strong> and <strong>pesticides</strong> across complex landscapes and channel systems to the watershed outlet.'
    item4: 'Recently, the <strong>carbon fate</strong> and <strong>transport</strong> function of <strong>CENTURY</strong> model was incorporated in the latest version of APEX (version 2110). This allows APEX to simulate carbon dynamics in soil-plant system.'
    item5: 'APEX also has <strong>groundwater</strong> and <strong>reservoir</strong> components. A field or watershed can be subdivided as much as necessary to assure that each subarea is relatively homogeneous in terms of soil, land use, management, etc.'
    item6: 'The <strong>routing mechanisms</strong> provide for evaluation of interactions between subareas involving <strong>surface runoff, return flow, sediment deposition</strong> and <strong>degradation, nutrient transport,</strong> and <strong>groundwater flow.</strong>'
    item7: 'Water quality in terms of <strong>nitrogen</strong> (ammonium, nitrate, and organic), <strong>phosphorus</strong> (soluble and adsorbed/mineral and organic), and <strong>pesticides concentrations</strong> may be estimated for each subarea and at the watershed outlet.'
    item8: 'Commercial or manure may be applied at any rate and depth on specified dates or automatically.'

    When using this system, the weather and soil information can be uploaded from weather stations and databases, so minimal or no user input is required in later pages.
    There are <strong>4 options</strong> within the mapping system.<br></br>
    <strong>1. Choose an AOI type to begin drawing</strong><br>
    <strong>Drawing an Area of Interest Selection (AOIs):</strong> The user first needs to select the button <img src="/serve_image/drawing_tool.png"> at the top center, in order to draw an AOI in the GIS map. It is drawn by connecting dots with the mouse, creating a figure. A field is considered an area of interest in NTT. After drawing the field, a message will pop up telling the user to enter the name of the farm. Enter the name of the field and advance. As the user enters the name, it will replace the default name in the text box for the field. From this point the field name entered will refer to the selected location.
    Once the user clicks <strong>OK</strong>, the field location will be highlighted.<br></br>
    <strong>Submitting:</strong> Finally, once you have drawn the AOI, you need to click the <strong>Submit</strong> button. The actual map is a different program that is being run within NTT. By clicking <strong>Submit</strong>, the drawings are actually submitted to NTT.<br></br>
    <strong>Deleting AOIs:</strong> To remove an AOI, first select the field that you would like to delete, and then click the <strong>Remove</strong> button.<br></br>
    <strong>2. Choose AOIs shapefile to upload</strong><br>
    <strong>Shapefile Format:</strong> You will need to upload a file that consists of at least four files with the same name but different extensions (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj). Ensure that the .shp file is the format of an ESRI Shapefile that uses the geographic coordinate system (latitude and longitude). The shapefiles need to within a zip folder, and you need to upload that zip folder.<br></br>
    <strong>Choosing a Shapefile:</strong> To choose a shapefile, select the button <strong>Choose file</strong> under the Upload Shapefile.<br></br>
    <strong>Uploading a Shapefile:</strong> To upload a shapefile, click the <strong>Upload Shapefile</strong> button. Make sure that you have chosen a shapefile.<br></br>
    <strong>Submitting a Shapefile:</strong> You need to submit the changes to the map once you have uploaded. Be sure to click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.<br></br>
    <strong>3. Choose area of interest by address</strong></br>
    <strong>Zooming to Address:</strong> By typing in a valid United States address, you can zoom in to a particular address of interest. You can zoom in to a city (Stephenville, Texas for example), or zoom in to a more exact location by typing in the entire address.<br></br>
    <strong>Drawing AOIs:</strong> This option only allows you to zoom in to the particular area of interest. You need to draw the AOI, once you have done this in the same way that you would if you had used <strong>Option 1</strong>. View the instructions for <strong>Option 1</strong> above if you have any problems with drawing AOIs.<br></br>
    <strong>4. Choose an area of interest by latitude/longitude</strong><br>
    <strong>Type in the Coordinates:</strong> While typing in the coordinates make sure that you are using the correct format (Latitude comes before longitude, North latitude is positive, East longitude is positive).<br></br>
    <strong>Choose State and County</strong><br>To zoom to a particular state/county in the United States the user can select the State and County from the corresponding drop down list boxes.

    The user has different options available when choosing the weather. Once the user has selected a method for weather information selection, the user will need to select the period to simulate, or the time period for which the user would like to do the simulation.
    <br></br>
    <strong>Selecting Weather Information</strong><br>
    There are three different methods to select the weather information.<br></br>
    <strong>Weather Station Using PRISM Data</strong><br>
    This method is available only when the State/County method was chosen to select the area of interest. This method takes weather data from a weather station inside or near the State/County that was selected in that page and uses that data to do the simulation. First the user must select <strong>Weather Station Using PRISM Data</strong> and then select the preferred weather station.
    Finally, once the station has been selected, click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> to save the information and continue to the next page.<br></br>
    <strong>Load Your Own Weather File</strong><br>
    This method of weather selection is always available regardless of the method used for selecting an area of interest. This option is also the only option that is available when using the NTT tool for locations outside of the mainland United States. To use this method the following are the instructions to
    <strong>Create a Weather File</strong>. In order to upload a weather file, the user must first create one. The weather file needs to be in a text file, and it should have the following format, blanks (columns 1-2), year (columns 3-6), month (columns 7-10), day (columns 11-14), solar radiation (columns 15-20; could be blank or zero), maximum temperature in Celsius (columns 21-26), minimum temperature in Celsius (columns 27-32), precipitation in millimeters (columns 33-38). This is for the first year/month/day. The same pattern is used for the rest of the days that you want to add to the simulation. Specific weather information for each day can simply be added by adding new records. Each record should contain the weather information for a specific day.
    The information above, for example, would show weather information for January 1, 1981 (where the solar radiation was 0, the max temperature was 10.1 degrees Celsius, the min temperature was -0.9 degrees Celsius, and precipitation was 0.00 millimeters), and the weather information for January 2, 1981 (where the solar radiation was 0, the max temperature was 5.7 degrees Celsius, the min temperature was -5.9 degrees Celsius, and precipitation was 0.00 millimeters). Ideally, you would have a file that contains detailed information for the weather for an extended period. Even though the file is significantly larger, all of the days for which we have data follow the same format.<br></br>
    <strong>Upload the Weather File</strong><br> Once the weather file has been created, the user needs to upload the file to the NTT program. First the user needs to select from the options. Next, the user needs to click. This will bring up an “Open” folder where the user can search their computer for the weather file. When you have selected the file click “Open”. This will show a progress bar as the system uploads the information.
    The records will have been uploaded when 100% of the records have been uploaded, and a green message will come up on the top of the screen . Once this has happened the user needs to select the Period to Simulate (which is explained below under Period to Simulate) and then click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> to save the information and advance to the next page.<br>
    <strong>NOTE</strong> It is important to note that when you click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> after uploading a weather file, the weather information is saved temporarily for the current session. This means that the weather information from uploaded weather files <strong>IS NOT SAVED</strong> when you save the project. Because of this, after opening a saved project where the user previously uploaded the weather file, the user needs to upload the weather file again, and to ensure that the simulation results are accurate run the any simulations again.<br></br>
    <strong>Load Using Specific Coordinates (U.S.A only)</strong><br>
    This method of weather selection will always appear as available regardless of the location method that was selected in the Location page (this method will work for the User Input method). However, the coordinates selected must be coordinates within the United States. This means that while the option will appear as available if the user selected “User Input” in the Location page, if they are looking at an area of interest that is outside the mainland United States an error message will come up.
    To use this method, first select <strong>Load Using Specific Coordinates (U.S.A only)</strong> and then enter the desired coordinates and click the <strong>Save Coordinates</strong> button. You will (like in all the other methods) need to select a period to simulate (which is discussed below) but after this has been done, you can click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> to save the information and continue.<br></br>
    <strong>Period to Simulate</strong><br>
    The period to simulate tool allows you to select the number of years that you would like to simulate. You can type in the years as shown below that you would like to simulate for. However, the program will simulate five years before the year that you selected as a method to warm up and give the user more accurate simulation results. Because of this, the user must select a start year that is at least five years after the initial year for which weather information is available. For example, if weather information is available from 1981 to 2012, the user must select a start year for the period to simulate that is 1986 or later. In the Results page, the last twelve years that are simulated are shown on the graphs. However, if there were less than twelve years in the Period to Simulate, then all of the years are accounted for in the graphs. <strong>The “Period to Simulate” information is required for all weather options.</strong>

  operation_html:
      <strong>Operations</strong><br></br>
      The <b>Operation</b> Page lets the user manipulate the cropping system.
      A cropping system is <b>REQUIRED</b> for the user to be able to advance and simulate the results. The user can add rotations that are one year in length or much longer. They can have multiple crops, or a single crop. There are different options available in <b>Operation Page</b> for manipulating a cropping system. All of them are described below.<br></br>
      <strong>Add Crop to Rotation</strong><br>
      Using this option opens a new page which allows the user to select from common cropping systems. To do this, the user needs to click on the <strong>Add Crop to Rotation</strong> button. The user can manipulate these pre-existing cropping systems once they are added.<br></br>
      <strong>Add New Operation</strong><br>
      The user can also create a new Cropping System from scratch. To do this, the user needs to click on the <strong>Add New Operation</strong> button. This will take the user to a new page, there the user needs to select the crop, the operation, and type in the year (this is important if the crop rotation involves multiple crops over multiple years – CORN year 1 and SOYBEAN year 2), month, and day. Depending on the Operation that is selected, more options may be required to be entered or selected by the user (for example planting requires plant population and planting method). If required, the user can also change the Nutrient composition. Click <strong>Add More</strong> to add another new operation, click <strong>finish</strong> to save the new operation, click <strong>Back</strong> to go back to the Operation Page.<br><br>
      If the user decides to change the values or any other inforamtion of an operation, the user can change the values of the operation by clicking on the <img src="/serve_image/edit.png"> icon in the <b>Actions</b> column. This will take the user to a new page where they can make the required changes to the operation.<br><br>
      If the user decides that an operation created was not necessary, the user can delete the operation by clicking on the <img src="/serve_image/delete.png"> icon in the <b>Actions</b> column. Then the user can proceed to the next page by clicking <strong> Continue </strong>.
      User can click <strong>Switch View</strong> to see detail values of all operations in one table.<br><br>
      Click <strong>Continue</strong> to go to the Conservation Practices Page.
  bmpnav_html:
      <strong>Best Management Practices (BMPs)</strong><br></br>
      Once a cropping system has been added, the user can simply save and continue to the results page for simulation. However, if the user would like to apply a best management practice to the cropping system, he or she can do so in the <b>Best Management Practices</b> Page.<br></br>
      <strong>Adding a BMP</strong><br>
      To add a BMP, the user needs to select a BMP by clicking on the check box under the <b>Select</b> column. This expands the selected Best Management Practices (BMPs) title and shows all the information required for adding the particular BMP. The BMPs are organized by groups, and the users can select which they are interested in adding. To add the BMP, expand the particular group (for example Auto Irrigation and Fertigation) and then select the specific BMP (for example Auto Irrigation).
      Then the user needs to enter the information for the particular BMP. Whenever there is a text box, the user can hover over the text box to see a range of acceptable values.
      Where there is a drop-down menu with the title <b>Select One</b> allows the user to select from a range of options.
      Where there is a checkbox <b>Select</b> the user can simply click on it to select the BMP.
      Remember that, if a BMP is expanded when you first get to the page, it means that this BMP has been selected.<br></br>
      <strong>Mutually Exclusive BMPs</strong><br>
      Some BMPs can co-exist with other BMPs. For the most part, most BMPs can co-exist with other BMPs. However there are a few mutually exclusive BMPs. The following BMP combinations are not allowed on NTT, and will come up with a message asking which one of the two BMPs you would like to have;<br>
      1. Auto Irrigation and Auto Fertigation.<br>
      2. Auto Irrigation and any Pads and Pipes.<br>
      3. Only one Pads and Pipes is allowed at the same time.<br>
      4. Filter Strip and Riparian Buffer.<br>
      5. Waterways and Riparian Buffer.<br>
      6. Filter Strip and Waterways.<br>
      7. Contour Buffer and Filter Strip/Riparian Buffer.<br></br>
      Other than these combinations, any combination (whether logical or not) is allowed on the NTT program.<br><br>

    auto:
        header: Autoirrigation and Autofertigation
        body: Autoirrigation
        body1: 'Automatic irrigation systems are irrigation systems that are controlled by a computerized controller. Autoirrigation overall can greatly increase crop yield. Within NTT, the autoirrigation feature will irrigate the field when certain user-supplied criteria for water stress and frequency are met, and will limit water application to the user supplied maximum application amount. User inputs required for auto irrigation include:'
        item1: '<strong>Irrigation Type:</strong> Irrigation types include sprinkler, furrow/flood, drip, and furrow diking.'
        item2: '<strong>Irrigation Efficiency:</strong> This value is the fraction of irrigation application that is not lost to runoff. This must be a value that is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. The closer the value is to 0, the greater the percentage of water lost to runoff and does not reach the crop. A value of 1 means that no water was lost to runoff. Different irrigation systems have different irrigation efficiencies. NTT supplies typical irrigation efficiency values for the irrigation type selected, but these values can be modified by the user.'
        item3: '<strong>Irrigate a Maximum of every (0-365) days:</strong> This field is asking for the maximum frequency (in days) that irrigation can take place. If the frequency is set to 1, then irrigation can occur every day. If frequency is set to 7 then irrigation can occur, at most, once a week. The value can be any whole number greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 365.'
        item4: '<strong>Water Stress Factor:</strong> The water stress factor indicates the water stress level of the crop. This is the value that is used to trigger the start of auto irrigation. For example, if water stress is set to 0.8 then NTT will trigger an irrigation event when the crop is 80% water-stressed, as long as conditions for maximum frequency are also met. The water stress factor can be any value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. The closer the value is to 1, the less water stress is allowed before the automatic irrigation is turned on.'
        item5: '<strong>Maximum Single Application:</strong> This value signifies the maximum amount of water than can be applied in a single irrigation event. It is in inches, and it can be any number greater than 0. If there are no constraints on the maximum single application, this value should be set to a high number.'
        body2: Autofertigation
        body3: 'Autofertigation is the application of fertilizers, soil amendments, or other water-soluble products through an autoirrigation system. Autofertigation is an automatic fertilization process in which fertilizer is dissolved and distributed through the irrigation system. This makes autofertigation very similar to autoirrigation with the only additional user input required being nitrogen concentration.'
        item6: '<strong>Nitrogen Concentration:</strong> The amount of nitrogen in irrigation water in parts per million. Total N applied through autofertigation will be dependent upon the overall irrigation frequency which in turn is dependent upon water stress, frequency and maximum application factors set by the user.'
        body4: '<strong>Note:</strong> Nutrients applied through autofertigation are in addition to the nutrients from commercial and manure fertilizers that are applied to the crop (as part of the fertilizer operations). If you spray-irrigate manure on your field periodically it is best to represent this as a manure application and not through the autofertigation feature.'
    drain:
       header: Tile Drain
       body1: 'Tile drainage is a practice for removing excess subsurface water from agricultural soils using perforated pipes. Drainage brings excessive soil moisture levels down for optimal crop growth. Tile drainage is often the best recourse for reducing high subsurface water levels to improve crop yields. Too much subsurface water can be counterproductive to agriculture by preventing root development, and inhibiting the growth of crops. Excessive water also can limit access to the land, particularly by farm machinery.'
       body2: 'For NTT applications, underground drainage systems are simulated in APEX. The depth of the drainage system to reduce plant stress is a key parameter used in simulating tile drainage systems in NTT. Tile drainage simulation in NTT increases subsurface flow, which may provide an avenue for increased nutrient losses in subsurface flow. The only input for tile drains is depth.'
       item1: '<strong>Depth:</strong> This is the depth in feet at which the drainage system is installed. It is any number greater than 0.'
    wetlands:
       header: Wetlands
       body1: 'Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.'
       body2: 'The wetland area is simulated as a shallow reservoir (1 ft. depth) with growing wetland vegetation – it is essentially simulated as an artificial wetland and not a natural wetland. The slope of wetland area is set as 1%. Simulated wetlands trap sediment, reduce runoff, increase infiltration, and also increase uptake of water and nutrients by the vegetation in the area covered by the wetland. Inputs required for wetlands include:'
       item1: '<strong>Area:</strong> The area of the wetland is input in acres. Since this area is no longer able to be used for crop production, there may be a lower total crop yield (although there may be a greater crop yield/acre).'
       item2: '<strong>Is wetland area included in your AOI?:</strong> Users indicate here whether the AOI representing the field includes the wetland feature within the drawn polygon or if the wetland feature lies outside of the AOI. If the wetland feature is included in the AOI, then the wetland acres will be subtracted from the field area.'
    ponds:
       header: Ponds/Water and Sediment Control Basins
       body1: 'Water and sediment control basins (WASCOBs), or ponds, consist of an embankment across the slope of a field or minor waterway to temporarily detain and release water through a piped outlet or through infiltration. They are constructed perpendicular to the flow direction and parallel to each other. WASCOBs are usually installed in areas where the land is relatively steep and undulating. They detain water from contributing areas, inducing sedimentation and controlling the release of water, thereby reducing the erosive power of the water downstream. Additional benefits are settling of sediment-bound pollutants and some infiltration. Only one input is required for ponds: fraction of area controlled by ponds.'
       body2: '<strong>Fraction of Area Controlled by Ponds:</strong> This is the fraction (a value between 0 and 1) of the field runoff that flows through (is controlled by) the pond/WASCOB. As modeled, ponds only treat runoff that originates in this field. Inflow from other fields is not routed through the ponds. Ponds/WASCOBs are assumed to be within field.'
    buffer:
       header: Grass Buffer/Forest Buffer
       body: Forest Buffer
       body1: 'Forest buffers are linear wooded areas with well-developed root systems, an organic surface layer, and understory vegetation. When they are adjacent to open water they are referred to as riparian forest buffers. Non-riparian buffers are linear wooded areas along down-slope field edges. Forest buffers trap sediment and increase infiltration, thereby reducing sediment and nutrient losses. Forest buffers often include a grass buffer between the field and the forested buffer. If present, please also include the width and vegetation type of the grass buffer.'
       body2: 'The inputs for Forest Buffer are the following:'
       item1: '<strong>Area (ac.):</strong> This is the total area of the Riparian Buffer. This field is optional. If left blank, the area will automatically be calculated using the width of the buffer and the length of the field edge (where the field edge is calculated as the square root of the area of the field).'
       item2: '<strong>Grass Strip Width (ft.):</strong> This is the width of the grass strip between the crop and the forested buffer, if present.'
       item3: '<strong>Forest Strip Width (ft.):</strong> This is the width of the forest buffer (not including the grass strip).'
       item4: '<strong>Fraction of field treated by buffer:</strong> This is the estimated fraction (0.00-1.00) of the runoff from the field that is routed through the buffer.'
       item5: '<strong>Is buffer included in AOI?:</strong> If buffer has been drawn as part of the AOI, then the area will be subtracted from the crop area. If it has not been drawn as part of the AOI, it will be assumed to be adjacent to one edge of the field.'
       body3: Grass Buffer
       body4: 'Grass buffers, also known as a filter strips, are an area of vegetation, generally narrow in width and long across the downslope edge of a field, that slows the rate of runoff, allowing sediments, organic matter, and other pollutants that are being conveyed by the water to be removed by settling out. Filter strips reduce erosion and the accompanying sediment-bound pollution.'
       body5: 'In NTT, filter strips function by providing for better infiltration of soluble nutrients, trapping of sediment, and increased uptake of water and nutrients by the filter strip vegetation. The saturated conductivity value is also modified for filter strip simulation in NTT.'
       body6: 'The inputs for grass buffers are the same as for forest buffers (see Forest Buffer), with the additional requirement that the user specify type of vegetation.'
       item6: '<strong>Vegetation:</strong> This is the type of grass or vegetation that is planted in the Filter Strip.'
    waterway:
       header: Grass Waterway
       body1: 'A grassed waterway is a natural or constructed swale, shaped or graded and established in suitable vegetation for the safe conveyance of runoff. Grassed waterways are designed to prevent soil erosion while draining runoff water from adjacent cropland. As water travels down the waterway, the grass vegetation prevents erosion that would otherwise result from concentrated flows and uptakes nutrients. Grassed waterways also help prevent gully erosion in areas of concentrated flow. For example, they may be used to drain runoff from terraces and runoff water diversions. By intercepting runoff, grassed waterways slow erosion and minimize nutrient losses. The inputs for Waterways include:'
       item1: '<strong>Crop:</strong> This is the type of grass or vegetation that is used in the channel.'
       item2: '<strong>Width:</strong> This is the width of the grassed waterway, in feet, including both sides of the vegetated channel. This can be any number greater than 0.'

    contour:
       header: Contour Buffer (Strip Farming)
       body1: 'Contour buffer strips are permanent, narrow bands of grasses/legumes planted on the contour (across or perpendicular to a slope) between wider strips of crops. Contour buffers trap sediment and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. User input fields for contour buffers include:'
       item1: '<strong>Crop:</strong> This is the type of grass or vegetation that will be present in the buffer sections of the contour buffer.'
       item2: '<strong>Grass Buffer Width:</strong> This is the width, in feet, of the buffer strips. It can be any number greater than 0. Buffer width, along with crop width, determine the number of buffer and crop strips in the field.'
       item3: '<strong>Crop Buffer Width:</strong> This is the width, in feet, of the strips of the main crop that was planted. It can be any number greater than 0. Crop width, along with buffer width, determine the number of buffer and crop strips in the field.'
    leveling:
       header: Land Leveling
       body1: 'Land leveling is used to reduce the slope on high soil slopes. By reducing the slope, the surface land is better able to retain water and soil, reducing erosion and increasing infiltration. The input for land leveling is slope reduction percentage.'
       item1: '<strong>Slope Reduction:</strong> This is the percent reduction in the slope of the soil. The number can be any percentage between 0% and 100%. The closer the slope is to 100, the more the slope is reduced.'
    terrace:
       header: Terrace System
       body1: 'A terrace system is a leveled section of a hill cultivated area, designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of water. Terraces decrease hill slope-length, reduce formation of gullies, and intercept and conduct runoff to a safe outlet thereby reducing sediment content in runoff water. Often, in application the landscape is formed into multiple terraces, giving a stepped appearance. Terraces are simulated by reducing the practice factor (PEC). If you would like to apply a terrace system, click on the <strong>Select</strong> button.'
    manure:
       header: Manure Control
       body1: 'The Manure Control practice group appears only if manure is applied in the management scenario. There are three manure technologies currently included in NTT: Primary Screen, DAF and NH3 stripper. Primary screen involves the removal of solids from liquid manure. Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is an advanced manure separation process to remove solids and phosphorus from manure. NH3 stripper is a process of stripping ammonia from digested manures. Each process impacts the nutrient composition of the liquid manure that is then applied to fields. When selecting a manure technology, the manure composition fields will pre-populate with default values showing the expected change in manure composition. Users may modify these values if desired.'

    apex1: 'NTT uses a biophysical simulation model, the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender model (APEX), version 0806, to process user supplied information (APEX; Williams et al., 2000). Below are characteristics of the APEX model.'
    item1: 'The  <a href="https://epicapex.tamu.edu/"><u>APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender)</u></a> model was developed to extend the <strong>EPIC</strong> model capabilities to whole farms and small watersheds (Williams et al., 2000).'
    item2: 'The individual field simulation components of EPIC were used for APEX development.'
    item3: 'In addition to the EPIC functions, APEX has components for <strong>routing water, sediment, nutrients,</strong> and <strong>pesticides</strong> across complex landscapes and channel systems to the watershed outlet.'
    item4: 'Recently, the <strong>carbon fate</strong> and <strong>transport</strong> function of <strong>CENTURY</strong> model was incorporated in the latest version of APEX (version 2110). This allows APEX to simulate carbon dynamics in soil-plant system.'
    item5: 'APEX also has <strong>groundwater</strong> and <strong>reservoir</strong> components. A field or watershed can be subdivided as much as necessary to assure that each subarea is relatively homogeneous in terms of soil, land use, management, etc.'
    item6: 'The <strong>routing mechanisms</strong> provide for evaluation of interactions between subareas involving <strong>surface runoff, return flow, sediment deposition</strong> and <strong>degradation, nutrient transport,</strong> and <strong>groundwater flow.</strong>'
    item7: 'Water quality in terms of <strong>nitrogen</strong> (ammonium, nitrate, and organic), <strong>phosphorus</strong> (soluble and adsorbed/mineral and organic), and <strong>pesticides concentrations</strong> may be estimated for each subarea and at the watershed outlet.'
    item8: 'Commercial or manure may be applied at any rate and depth on specified dates or automatically.'
