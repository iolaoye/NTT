    thanks: 'Thank you very much for using this program. The current version of “Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT): Next generation” is designed to assess the environmental and economic impacts of various management practices on water and air quality at the filed or small watershed level. The NTT is an Internet-based program and requires no software to download. NTT imports the required databases, such as weather, soil, management, and land geometry at the selected land (agricultural, forestry, and urban) for the user using the existing GIS and non-GIS based database anywhere in the mainland United States. The NTT simulate the baseline and numerous conservation management scenarios using the APEX (Agricultural Policy/Extender; Williams et al. 2010) (Version 0806) model. Please review “about NTT” section for information regarding the new functions and science in current version of NTT. For detailed information please refer to the manual or contact Dr. Ali Saleh by e-mail at saleh@tiaer.tarleton.edu or by phone (254) 968-9799.'
    note1: '1. Although the database in NTT available for mainland USA, access to the databases for NTT simulation is limited to where the NTT has been tested and verified. This assure the users that results obtained from this version of NTT is relatively reliable for the conditions where the program has been verified. However, the last version of NTT (www.nn.tarleton.edu/ntt) allows the users to access the data throughout the mainland US.'
    note2: '2. This version of NTT is written both in English and Spanish languages.'
    final: 'Finally, as the NTT project leader and behalf of all of my project team (Oscar Gallego and Edward Osei), I would like to thank the funding sources and our colleagues, in particular the farmers and producers, for their contribution in designing this program.'

Riparian forests are simulated in a manner similar to the filter strip practice with the additional assumption that there are trees along the length of the riparian zone in addition to selected crops that are growing in the simulated area.

Conversely, for Total Area and Crops, the difference is expressed as the amount increased from “First Scenario” to “Second Scenario”. Negative numbers here indicate a reduction from “First Scenario” to “Second Scenario”. Again, <b>negative numbers in the difference and reduction % represent an undesirable result and positive numbers indicate a desired result.</b>'
            body5: 'The Total Area column represents something different than the Total Area row. Because the results under the two scenarios are PER ACRE, the Total Area column allows you to view the difference that this would cause for the entire area selected by the user in previous pages. For instance, in the example shown above, the Total Area value for CORN is 1100. This means that for the entire field (not just per acre), the user is produces 1100 more crops using the alternative scenario versus the baseline scenario. For Total N, Total P, Total Flow, and Sediment a negative value on <b>Total Area</b> indicate an increase from <b>First Scenario</b> to <b>Second Scenario</b>. For these, you can calculate <b>Total Area</b> by using the following formula: <b>(baseline value * total area) – (alternative value * total area)</b>. Conversely for Crops, a negative value on <b>Total Area</b> indicates a decrease from <b>First Scenario</b> to <b>Second Scenario</b>.

To select this method you need to select <b>Annual (Last 12 Years)</b> under the first drop down box above the chart, as shown below.'
                body2: 'Once this option has been selected, the user needs to select the results that they would like to view, as shown below. This will bring up the selected results on the graph.'

Again, unlike the tabular method of viewing results, you cannot view the average for the entire time here. Rather you will see an average all of the January results, an average of all the February results, etc. To select this method follow the same instructions as for the annual method (described above), except that instead of selecting <b>Annual (Last 12 Years)</b> under the first drop down box, you need to select <b>Monthly Average (The entire period).</b> An example graph for the monthly average is shown below:'
