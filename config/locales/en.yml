  welcome_note:
    thanks: 'Thank you very much for using this program. The current version of “Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT): Next generation” is designed to assess the environmental and economic impacts of various management practices on water and air quality at the field or small watershed level. The NTT is an Internet-based program and requires no software to download. NTT imports the required databases, such as weather, soil, management, and land geometry at the selected land (agricultural, forestry, and urban) for the user using the existing GIS and non-GIS based database anywhere in the mainland United States. The NTT simulate the baseline and numerous conservation management scenarios using the APEX (Agricultural Policy/Extender; Williams et al. 2010) (Version 0806) model. Please review “about NTT” section for information regarding the new functions and science in current version of NTT. For detailed information please refer to the manual or contact Dr. Ali Saleh by e-mail at saleh@tiaer.tarleton.edu or by phone (254) 968-9799.'
    note1: '1. Although the database in NTT available for mainland USA, access to the databases for NTT simulation is limited to where the NTT has been tested and verified. This assure the users that results obtained from this version of NTT is relatively reliable for the conditions where the program has been verified. However, the last version of NTT (www.nn.tarleton.edu/ntt) allows the users to access the data throughout the mainland US.'
    note2: '2. This version of NTT is written both in English and Spanish.'
    final: 'Finally, as the NTT project leader and behalf of all of my project team (Oscar Gallego and Edward Osei), I would like to thank the funding sources and our colleagues, in particular the farmers and producers, for their contribution in designing this program.'

    <strong>Weather Page</strong><br></br>
    The user has different options available when choosing the weather. Once the user has selected a method for weather information selection, the user will need to select the period to simulate, or the time period for which the user would like to do the simulation.
    <br></br>
    <strong>Selecting Weather Information</strong><br>
    There are three different methods to select the weather information.<br></br>
    <strong>Weather Station Using PRISM Data</strong><br>
    This method is available only when the State/County method was chosen to select the area of interest. This method takes weather data from a weather station inside or near the State/County that was selected in that page and uses that data to do the simulation. First the user must select <strong>Weather Station Using PRISM Data</strong> and then select the preferred weather station.
    Finally, once the station has been selected, click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> to save the information and continue to the next page.<br></br>
    <strong>Load Your Own Weather File</strong><br>
    This method of weather selection is always available regardless of the method used for selecting an area of interest. This option is also the only option that is available when using the NTT tool for locations outside of the mainland United States. To use this method the following are the instructions to
    <strong>Create a Weather File</strong>. In order to upload a weather file, the user must first create one. The weather file needs to be in a text file, and it should have the following format, blanks (columns 1-2), year (columns 3-6), month (columns 7-10), day (columns 11-14), solar radiation (columns 15-20; could be blank or zero), maximum temperature in Celsius (columns 21-26), minimum temperature in Celsius (columns 27-32), precipitation in millimeters (columns 33-38). This is for the first year/month/day. The same pattern is used for the rest of the days that you want to add to the simulation. Specific weather information for each day can simply be added by adding new records. Each record should contain the weather information for a specific day.
    The information above, for example, would show weather information for January 1, 1981 (where the solar radiation was 0, the max temperature was 10.1 degrees Celsius, the min temperature was -0.9 degrees Celsius, and precipitation was 0.00 millimeters), and the weather information for January 2, 1981 (where the solar radiation was 0, the max temperature was 5.7 degrees Celsius, the min temperature was -5.9 degrees Celsius, and precipitation was 0.00 millimeters). Ideally, you would have a file that contains detailed information for the weather for an extended period. Even though the file is significantly larger, all of the days for which we have data follow the same format.<br></br>
    <strong>Upload the Weather File</strong><br> Once the weather file has been created, the user needs to upload the file to the NTT program. First the user needs to select from the options. Next, the user needs to click. This will bring up an “Open” folder where the user can search their computer for the weather file. When you have selected the file click “Open”. This will show a progress bar as the system uploads the information.
    The records will have been uploaded when 100% of the records have been uploaded, and a green message will come up on the top of the screen . Once this has happened the user needs to select the Period to Simulate (which is explained below under Period to Simulate) and then click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> to save the information and advance to the next page.<br>
    <strong>NOTE</strong> It is important to note that when you click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> after uploading a weather file, the weather information is saved temporarily for the current session. This means that the weather information from uploaded weather files <strong>IS NOT SAVED</strong> when you save the project. Because of this, after opening a saved project where the user previously uploaded the weather file, the user needs to upload the weather file again, and to ensure that the simulation results are accurate run the any simulations again.<br></br>
    <strong>Load Using Specific Coordinates (U.S.A only)</strong><br>
    This method of weather selection will always appear as available regardless of the location method that was selected in the Location page (this method will work for the User Input method). However, the coordinates selected must be coordinates within the United States. This means that while the option will appear as available if the user selected “User Input” in the Location page, if they are looking at an area of interest that is outside the mainland United States an error message will come up.
    To use this method, first select <strong>Load Using Specific Coordinates (U.S.A only)</strong> and then enter the desired coordinates and click the <strong>Save Coordinates</strong> button. You will (like in all the other methods) need to select a period to simulate (which is discussed below) but after this has been done, you can click <strong>Save and Continue</strong> to save the information and continue.<br></br>
    <strong>Period to Simulate</strong><br>
    The period to simulate tool allows you to select the number of years that you would like to simulate. You can type in the years as shown below that you would like to simulate for. However, the program will simulate five years before the year that you selected as a method to warm up and give the user more accurate simulation results. Because of this, the user must select a start year that is at least five years after the initial year for which weather information is available. For example, if weather information is available from 1981 to 2012, the user must select a start year for the period to simulate that is 1986 or later. In the Results page, the last twelve years that are simulated are shown on the graphs. However, if there were less than twelve years in the Period to Simulate, then all of the years are accounted for in the graphs. <strong>The “Period to Simulate” information is required for all weather options.</strong>
